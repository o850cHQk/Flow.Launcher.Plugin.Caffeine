Caffiene for Flow Launcher
==================
A plugin for [Flow launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher) that prevents your pc from sleeping or turning off the monitor.  
This is a replacement for [Caffeine](https://www.zhornsoftware.co.uk/caffeine/) that simply keeps your pc awake and screen on when active.  

Icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/).  
Thanks for that one guy on stackexchange that had a nice clean example of how power mangement works.
